Upon completion, SkyDrive will start and be accessible on the web at the Raspberry Pi's IP address or at `SkyDrive.local`.


# WebUI

**SkyDrive can be controlled via the WebUI which can be found at the Raspberry Pi's IP address or at `skydrive.local`**




# Parts List

SkyDrive was designed to work with a Raspberry Pi 5 due to the fast speeds of the PCIe and WIFI adapter and should be compatible with any NVMe drive connected over the Pi's PCIe lanes. 

Our picture build contains 3 main parts.
1. [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)
2. [X1001 PCIe to M.2 Key-M NVMe SSD PIP TOP](https://geekworm.com/products/x1001)
3. [X1202 4-Cell 18650 5.1V 5A UPS HAT](https://geekworm.com/products/x1202)

Skydrive can also be run without batteries or an ups hat, like a mini NAS server.
